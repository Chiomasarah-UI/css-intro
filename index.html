        <h2>MY LOVE FOR TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p> my name is <b>Abana chioma,</b>While growing up I was exposed to the newest technologies of cell phones that came into my family’s cellphone store in Nigeria where I was raised. Regardless of my low age, I was able to quickly understand and gain a passion for technology. My family did not only sell phones but they also repaired them and provided tech support for customers. As a six year old kid, I would learn from my older brothers all they knew about current technologies.
            Thanks to the background that I was raised in, I was able to create an interest for all kinds of technology. I would spend countless hours looking at the components of the broken phones and replace them with working parts. My family would then give me a part of the profit of the phones I repaired. This made me realize that I could make a living as a computer engineer.
            As I continued my education, I was not given many opportunities to develop my skills as a technician but all the chances that I got I valued them and took full advantage of the opportunities offered. Due to this lack of support through the public education system I was forced to learn and continue developing my passion on my own free time. After my university, I decided to learn more about programming. I still continue to have my passion for technology and love sharing my knowledge about it with my friends. <em>I thank my parents for providing me with a background in technology that not many have had the luck to have.</em> 
            I will continue to grow on my passion for technology as I go off to college. I hope to someday have the materials to experiment and express myself in a creative technologic environment.</p>

        <h2>MY JOURNEY SO FAR</h2>
        <p>
            <b>What Is CSS?</b><br>
            CSS stands for cascading style sheets. In short, <em>CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text.</em> Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language. Think “look and feel” when you think CSS.<br>
            
            <b>How Does CSS Work with HTML?</b><br>
            If HTML were the engine components of a car, CSS would be the body style and the paint job. A website can run without CSS, but it certainly isn’t pretty. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.<br>
            <b>Advantages of CSS:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li>
                <li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li>
                <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.</li>
                <li>sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</li>
                <li>It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
                <li>It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li>
                <li>CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various range of smart devices to access websites over the web, there’s a requirement for responsive web design.</li>
                <li>It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web elements who are there on the page.</li>
                <li>These bandwidth savings are substantial figures of insignificant tags that are indistinct from a mess of pages.</li>
                <li>Easy for the user to customize the online page</li>
                <li>It reduces the file transfer size.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARGINS,PADDINGS & BORDERS</h2>
        <p>
            In CSS, a <b>margin</b> is the space around an element’s border and <b>padding</b> is the space between an element’s border and the element’s content while <b>Border</b> is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be assigned colors to make them visible. Put another way, the <em>margin</em> property controls the space outside an element, and the <em>padding</em> property controls the space inside an element while the <em>border</em> sorrounds the element kinda like a fence.
